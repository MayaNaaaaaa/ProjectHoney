# utils.py
# Most common utility functions (like IP geo-location, reputation check, IP blocking)
# have been integrated directly into app.py for simplicity in this setup.
# If you plan to add more general-purpose helper functions that are not
# specific to Flask routes or app configuration, you can add them here later.
